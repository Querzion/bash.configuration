# bash.starship.installer
Installs StarShip, Configures it, and lets you change the theme of it. BTW! It installs ALL NerdFonts, not only symbols, so if you want it done differently; just delete some packages.

### WARNING!
The Script copies over my personal .bashrc and your .bashrc is renamed to .bashrc.kicked if you don't like this, just uncomment that part.
